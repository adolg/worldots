----------
*	Fixed a formatting error in the English manual and added contact
	information.

*	Default optimization level is now `-O3` (for no reason -- I am
	still convinced `-Ofast` is safe to use) and all compiler
	warnings are now disabled by default (the build will error out
	on empty compilation units when building without XLib, or with
	some other versions of GCC).

*	`cleanall` is now called `mrproper`, according to convention.

2013-05-27
----------
*	Additions to `config.mk` and `makefile` to facilitate packaging.
	`make install` also strips the binary now.

2013-05-24
----------
*	`-v` invocation prints more information about compile options.

*	Cleaned up `makefile` and `config.mk*`.
