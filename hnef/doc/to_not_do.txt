These are features that should NOT be implemented, but have been
considered and rejected.

*	The program should be kept as small and simple as possible. New
	features (especially æsthetic ones) should not be implemented
	lightly.

*	Dependencies should be avoided at all costs, even if required
	for significant features. This especially applies to GLib and
	GTK+.



General
-------
### `setlocale` ###
Reason:	Calling `setlocale` leaks memory when using XLib.

	The only benefit is localized `errno` strings, and they are of
	little use anyway since `HT_FR` failures always print a message.

### C99 / C11 migration ###
Performance improvements (such as restricted pointers and inlined
functions) are the only acceptable features from C99 and C11, and they
must be completely optional.

In particular, the boolean data type and `snprintf` from C99 should not
be used, and you are not allowed to use `//` comments.

Reason:	C89 is more portable. Keeping the code up-to-date in 3 different
	standards is probably not a good idea.

### Multi-threading ###
Reason:	The only purpose of multi-threading would be to make the XLib
	interface more responsive (the user doesn't have to wait for a
	full move to be recursed upon before his XLib input events are
	processed), but this is an extremely minor feature at a great
	cost: single-threading is simpler and more efficient.

	Also, the user will hardly play at a search depth that is so
	slow that it makes the interface unresponsive.



Build
-----
### Autoconf ###
Reason:	`config.mk` is much simpler.



HT_AI_MINIMAX
-------------
### Time limit for computer player ###
Reason:	You can already control search depth by toggling it, and you can
	control thinking time by forcing the computer to move (in XLib).



HT_UI_CLI
---------
### curses ###
A curses interface could make it possible to interrupt the computer
player while thinking, and make the CLI a little prettier.

Reason:	The command line interface exists for machines that don't have
	XLib and XPM. Many of them won't have curses either, and then
	they won't be able to use the program at all. The entire
	program, with CLI but without XLib, should depend on nothing but
	a C compiler. Therefore curses is an unacceptable dependency,
	unless added as a separate type of interface (while keeping the
	old CLI).



HT_UI_XLIB
----------
### Error handling ###
Protocol and I/O error handlers for XLib are not used.

Reason:	`free_uix` may not be allowed to call, for example, `XFreeGC` if
	XLib has malfunctioned (it may cause a segmentation fault).
	Therefore the only thing to do if XLib crashes is to terminate
	the rest of the program with a diagnostic, which is what the
	default handlers do.

	If XLib thinks it's a good idea to terminate the program, then
	it can presumably clean up any pixmaps that it has allocated on
	the server. All memory allocated by the program should be
	reclaimed by a decent operating system anyway.

### Window name ###
The window name is set to the name of the ruleset.

Reason:	If the ruleset requires a "name" argument for some other reason
	(which it doesn't), then this would require very little code to
	implement. As it is now, it's unnecessary to add another ruleset
	argument for it.

### Window icon ###
A window icon of an ægishjálmr would be cool. If so, it should be a
black symbol with a thin white outline on a circle with a yellow
background.

Reason:	Unnecessary memory. Not all window managers display it.
