 * takes up to (due to growing) HT_AI_MINIMAX_MEM_COL_MAX bytes.
 *
 * The table can not grow (arrc can not increase post-allocation).
 * Therefore it's useless to keep track of load factor.
 *
 * Both zhashtable->arr and zhashcols->memchunk store zhashnodes in a
 * continuous block of memory. That means that all zhashnodes will be
 * aligned to structure padding. A zhashnode with 32 bit pointers is 28
 * bytes (making some assumptions about data types), and with 64 bit
 * pointers 32 bytes. Thus no space is wasted when putting zhashnodes in
 * arrays.
 *
 * By contrast, if we had just naively used malloc every time we need to
 * add a new collision, we would allocate 32 bytes per zhashnode, since
 * malloc aligns to 16 bytes, thus wasting 4 bytes (16 * 2 - 28) per
 * zhashnode, in addition to causing heap fragmentation (though it
 * should be insignificant unless free immediately returns memory to the
 * operating system, which it doesn't on Linux at least).
 *
 * The benefit of collision lists is fast retrieval and deletion, but
 * zhashtable_clearunused achieves nearly equally fast deletion, and the
 * use of a single non-growable array for colliding nodes means no heap
 * fragmentation since they don't have to be allocated all the time.
 * Insertion is as fast.
