 * Checks if pt_adj (at b->pieces[adj]) is captured by an enemy piece

 *
 * This function assumes:
 *
 * *	pb_mov (the moving piece, who moved to dest) is a non-empty
 *	piece on the board, that can (potentially) capture pt_adj.
 *
 * *	pb_adj is a non-empty piece that can be captured by pb_mov.
 *
 * If that does not hold true, then this function may not be called.
 *
 * skipx and skipy are used to determine double-trapping. If you are not
 * checking a double trap, both should be 0. If you are checking a
 * double trap, then skipx should be -1 if the piece adjacent to pt_adj
 * (which may be surrounded by the double trap) is to the left of
 * pt_adj; +1 if it's to the right, and so on. This simply tells that
 * this function to hop one step further when checking in that
 * direction.
 *
 *	. . m .	// When checking if x is captured, you can give -1 skipx
 *	n y x m	// to move one more step in the x-axis to the left when
 *	. . m . // determining if x is surrounded (thus checking if x is
 *		// surrounded by m and n).
 *
 * skipx and skipy will maintain custodial capture rules, even when
 * hopping over several pieces.
 *
 * If either skipx or skipy is not 0, then this function may adapt
 * capt_sides and custodial (of pt_adj) to double trap rules. If both
 * are 0, this is not done.
 *
 * When using double capture rules, the following always happens (other
 * than maybe using other capt_sides and custodial rules):
 *
 * *	Lax custodial capture requirement is used. Normally the moving
 *	piece has to be the piece that surrounds custodially, but in
 *	this case it's enough that the piece has been surrounded
 *	custodially by any two pieces (not necessarily the moving one).
 *	The normal checking can be called "strict" custodial checking.
 *
 * (skipx and skipy can simply be negative, positive or 0. It doesn't
 * distinguish between -100 and -1 -- they are both treated as -1. Thus
 * you can only "hop" over one piece using skipx / skipy.)
 *
 * If a non-empty piece or square type that is on the board is not
 * defined in ruleset, then it always returns HT_FALSE, without giving
 * an indication of failure.

 * 4	Y	->	Z	No	revert-defense		Y -> .
 * 5	C	->	B	Yes	repeat-threat	C -> B
 *
 * (Note that MOVE 5 is pos / dest. Also note that we don't need to know
 * if pos / dest is a reversible move, because we know that if it moves
 * from C to B, and previously moved from ? -> B and then B -> C and
 * MOVE 1 and 3 are reversible, then MOVE 5 must also be reversible.)
 *
 * *	If any of the moves 1-4 is irreversible, then it's not
 *	repetition.
 *
 * *	A does not have to (but may) equal C. We already know it is the
 *	same piece.
 *	Thus move 3 is not necessarily strictly a reversion from C to A.
 *
 * *	X does not have to (but may) equal Z. We already know it is the
 *	same piece.
 *	Thus move 4 is not necessarily strictly a reversion from Y to X.
 *
 * *	A, X and Z are completely irrelevant since they don't have
 *	anything to do with the threat-defense exchange; for example, a
 *	piece could move from random square A to threat-square B, then
 *	to random square C (A != C) and back to threat-square B, and it
 *	would still be repetition. X and Z do not matter since the piece
 *	that moves to / from Y is assumed to defend, and the purpose of
 *	the rule is to forbit perpetual threats (you can usually choose
 *	to stop threatening without immediate loss, but that's typically
 *	not the case when defending -- thus the attacker is expected to
 *	alternate).
 *
 * NOTE:	Note that a piece moving from pos to dest, where dest is
 *		an escape square for the piece, causes the game to be
 *		over (won). Then no more moves will be made.
 *		moveh are only added by two functions: board_move_safe()
 *		and board_move_unsafe(). moveh structs are never
 *		retrieved from board_moves_get().
 *		Putting these facts together, it follows that an
 *		escaping move will never be the last move in a listmh
 *		when this function is called. The move to be evaluated
 *		is pos / dest, and if this function returns true, then
 *		it's implied that pos / dest does not constitute an
 *		escaping move.
 *		Therefore (in board_move_(un)safe()) we never check if a
 *		move is escaping when determining moveh->irrev. It will
 *		not affect the behavior of this function in any possible
 *		situation.
 *
 *		Also, if you moved from B to C, and are now moving back
 *		from C (pos) to B (dest), then C can not be a noreturn
 *		square for that piece while B is not -- then the move
 *		from B to C would've been illegal. Therefore we don't
 *		have to check for that in this function -- but we do
 *		need to check for it in board_move_unsafe() (which we
 *		also do).
 *
 * NOTE:	There may be odd situations where this gives false
 *		positives; and there may be odd situations where this
 *		doesn't properly trigger repetition.
